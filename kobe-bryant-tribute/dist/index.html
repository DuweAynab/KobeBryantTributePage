    <h3 id="headline"><strong>A timeline of Kobe's career and life accomplishments:</strong></h3> 
    <ul>
  <li>Bryant won the NBA championship five times with the Lakers, in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010.</li>
  <li>He was twice named MVP in the NBA Finals, in 2009 and 2010.</li>
 <li>Earned All-Star nod first in 1998, and then every year from 2000 to 2016, the year that he retired. Those 18 appearances put him second on the all-time list, with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar playing in 19 of the games.
</li>
  <li>Bryant was four times the NBA All-Star Game MVP, in 2002, 2007, 2009 and 2011.</li>
  <li>He received his lone NBA MVP award for the 2007-08 season, during which he became the youngest player to reach 20,000 career points, at the age of 29 years and 122 days.</li>
  <li>He sits fourth on the NBA all-time list of points-scorers with 33,643 from 1,346 games. Only Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone and LeBron James are ahead of him on the list.</li>
  <li>In the 2005-06 season, Bryant recorded his highest points-per-game average for a single campaign, with 35.4. He led the NBA in scoring in that season and in 2006-07.</li>
  <li>On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored 81 points in a 122-104 victory over the Toronto Raptors at Staples Center. That is the second highest individual score in an NBA game, behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100 for the Philadelphia Warriors against the New York Knicks in 1962.</li>
  <li>In his final game, on April 13, 2016, Bryant scored 60 points for the Lakers in a 101-96 win over the Utah Jazz.</li>
  <li>Bryant received All-NBA honours in 15 seasons, being named in the first team on 11 occasions. Only LeBron, with 13 appearances in the first team, beats Bryant's total.</li>
  <li>He was named nine times to the NBA All-Defense first team, matching the all-time high. Kevin Garnett, Michael Jordan and Gary Payton achieved the same total.</li>
  <li>Bryant was an NBA player of the month 17 times, and 32 times the player of the week.</li>
  <li>Bryant's success was not limited to NBA action either. He won Olympic gold medals with the United States in 2008 and 2012.</li>
  <li>He won an Oscar too, after his playing career ended, landing the Best Animated Short Film prize at the 2018 Academy Awards for "Dear Basketball".</li>
